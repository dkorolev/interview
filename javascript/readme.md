# Problem Statement

The [code.js](https://github.com/dkorolev/interview/blob/master/javascript/code.js) program is supposed to output:

```
Stage 1
Stage 2
Stage 3
Stage 4
Stage 5
Done!
```

1. Without running the code, could you answer does it do it?
1. What would you suggest changing in the code?

All the best!
